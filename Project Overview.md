Project Overview for "How Black Lives Matter Protests Help or Hinder Black Candidacy."

The uploaded RMDs contain the R code I used to clean and analyze protest and election data. All datasets are linked and cited within the RMD files. Two hand-collected datasets are uploaded as files. The project will be completed by March 2025, with the possibility for expansion later on.

Project Overview for "How Black Lives Matter Protests Affect Black/White Candidacy."

The uploaded RMDs contain the R code I used to clean and analyze protest and election data. All datasets are linked and cited within the RMD files.

The project will be completed by March 2025, with the possibility for expansion later on.

The next stages of the project include:
- Analyzing primary elections
- Analyzing governor elections
- Examining the effect of political party on outcomes
- Fine-tuning geographic matches for protest data and BISG
- Adjust for redistricting (currently, all House districts are computed using the 116th Congress)
- More manual race collection
- Other statistical modeling techniques besides logistic regression

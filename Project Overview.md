Project Overview for "How Black Lives Matter Protests Affect Black/White Candidacy."

The uploaded RMDs contain the R code I used to clean and analyze protest and election data. All datasets are linked and cited within the RMD files.

The project will be completed by March 2025, with the possibility for expansion later on.

The next stages of the project include:
- Gathering 2022 Senate data for electoral trends
- Analyzing primary elections
- Analyzing governor elections
- Examining national mood, margin of victory, party, and gender as variables
- Fine-tuning geographic matches for BISG to avoid dropped observations and inaccuracies
- Adjust for redistricting (currently, all House districts are computed using the 116th Congress)
- Conduct more manual race collection for improved accuracy
- Use other statistical modeling techniques besides logistic regression
